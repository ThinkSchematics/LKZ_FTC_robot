# LKZ_FTC_robot
A few weeks ago I was asked to help the local high school with their FTC robotics team.  I thought it would be a good challenge for me and help me broaden my coding.  I usually work in C, doing my Arduino projects.  I hope this code can help them out and you also.  Most of the code comes from watching this guyâ€™s youtube videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZQb2RKh2hu89M9L2rUxhw
though with some changes, mostly in adding comments.  I still need to add more comments to help myself remember what the code does, and to figure it out.  Also, it helps you to see what path I am/was taking.  

Good luck,
Johnny
